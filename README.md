# How English football teams' performance affect the evolution of the FTSE 100
We want to evaluate whether the results of English professional football teams affect the performance of the main UK stock market index, the FTSE 100. We have several datasets: domestic (club) football game results (>1M observations), international (national team) football game results (>45k observations) and the evolution of the FTSE 100 index in the last few decades. We want to join those and explore potential relationships.

The datasets have been obtained on:

https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/martj42/international-football-results-from-1872-to-2017 
https://uk.investing.com/indices/uk-100-historical-data

We will be using linear regression to find how different game results affect the evolution of the stock market during a full season, and logistic regression to predict whether certain results will turn out in a loss or a gain in the aftermath of the game for the stock market. We also want to see the correlation between number of wins in a season/tournament and the performance of the index along that period.
